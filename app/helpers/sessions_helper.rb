=begin
This places a temporary cookie on the user's browser containing 
an encrypted version of the user's id, which allows us to 
retrieve the id on subsequent pages using 
session[:user_id]. In contrast to the persistent 
cookie created by the cookies method, the temporary cookie 
created by the session method expires 
immediately when the browser is closed.
